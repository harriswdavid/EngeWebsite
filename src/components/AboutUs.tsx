          We are a six person team striving to reduce waste in our environment.
          Our engineering group was formed at the beginning of our semester, we
          were given the task to fix a problem on our campus at Virginia Tech.
          Our group brainstormed together and came to the conclusion that there
          was too much waste on campus and we wanted to find a solution. We
          decided that the lack of trash cans and their complexity was one of
          the leading causes of trash on campus. So we decided to create
          individual designs, each of them taking inspiration from our original
          idea of a trash can that holds different types of waste. After
          comparing these designs with each other, we collectively formed
          constraints and criteria to judge which design we wanted to move
          forward with the most. The constraints, expectations needed to manage
          the scope of the design, included holding different types of waste,
          being made out of materials found within our local lab (Virginia
          Techâ€™s Frith Lab), being recognisable as a trash can, and being easy
          to use by anyone. The criteria, measurable things our design needs to
          accomplish, included having 20-40 gallons of storage space combined,
          being 20-80 pounds in weight, and exceeding the budget of $50. Once a
          design was chosen we got to work, creating a model, turning it into a
          prototype, and developing a website around the trashcan.
